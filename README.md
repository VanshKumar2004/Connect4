# Connect 4 Console Game

## Project Overview
This is a console-based implementation of the classic **Connect 4** game developed using Java. The game supports both 2-player and single-player modes. The single-player mode is powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, which enables the computer to play intelligently against the user by making optimal moves.

## Features
- **2-Player Mode:** Two human players can take turns to drop their discs into the columns.
- **Single-Player Mode:** Play against a computer opponent using the Minimax algorithm.
- **Console Interface:** Simple text-based console interface for easy navigation and gameplay.
- **Efficient Game Logic:** The game leverages data structures to efficiently manage game states and moves.
- **AI Implementation:** The Minimax algorithm simulates strategic decision-making, ensuring challenging gameplay in single-player mode.

## How to Play
1. **Run the game:** Start the game from your console or IDE.
2. **Choose the mode:** Select either `2-player` mode or `Single-player` mode.
3. **Enter player names:** Enter the names of the players or set a name for yourself if playing against the computer.
4. **Make a move:** Enter the column number where you want to drop your disc.
5. **Alternate turns:** The game alternates turns until one player aligns four discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
6. **Win or Draw:** The game will declare a winner if four discs are aligned or a draw if the board is full.


## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Algorithm:** Minimax Algorithm
- **Data Structures:** 2D Array for the game board


## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
- Improve AI by implementing advanced heuristics.
- Add support for different difficulty levels in the single-player mode.
